\section{How this document works}

The document goes through each lecture in order, noting what we covered in the lecture. In particular, it highlights the key topics of the course, and marks for each how it may appear on the exam.

In particular, the coding works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If it is \isnp{highlighted like this}, that indicates that you are expected to be familiar with the statement to the degree that you could use it to show some other statement or solve an exercise, if the highlighted statement is provided to you.
  
  You could also be asked to provide a precise statement given a prompt as to what it is about -- so for example if you see \isnp{Dirac's theorem} in this document, an exam question might also be ``What does Dirac's theorem about the existence of Hamiltonian paths say?''. You are not expected to know the proof of the result.
  \item If it is \isip{highlighted like this}, you are expected to not only know the statement in the same sense as in the previous point, but also to have an idea of the proof of the theorem. So you might be asked to fill in a key step of the proof of the statement, write a precise proof given a prompt of what the general outline is, or write an outline of the idea of the proof.
  
  So if you see \isip{Dirac's theorem} in this document, an exam question might give you the proof of the result with the step where the maximal length path is turned into a cycle, and you are asked to fill in that step. Or you could be asked to write a proof, given that the drawings for the proof from the lecture notes are given to you. Or you could be asked to draw those figures and explain the broad idea of taking a maximal length path and showing that it can be turned into a cycle, which must be a Hamilton cycle.
  \item If it is \iskp{highlighted like this}, you are not expected to recall the exact statement without a prompt, but you are expected to be able to prove it without a reminder of the idea of the proof. So if you see \iskp{Dirac's theorem}, an exam question might look like ``State and prove Dirac's theorem about the existence of Hamilton cycles''.
  \item If it is \ksnp{highlighted like this}, you are expected to know the statement of the theorem without any prompt, but not expected to know the proof.
  
  So if you see \ksnp{Dirac's theorem} in this document, an exam question might be ``State Dirac's theorem'', but you would not be asked about the proof.
  \item If it is \ksip{highlighted like this}, you are expected to know the statement of the result, and additionally to have an idea of the proof. So \ksip{this} is the same as \ksnp{this} and \isip{this} together.
  \item Finally, if it is \kskp{highlighted like this}, you are expected to know both the theorem and its proof. If you see \kskp{Dirac's theorem}, that means you could see an exam question just ask ``State and prove Dirac's theorem''.
\end{enumerate}

For definitions, it of course makes no sense to refer to knowing a proof, so we simply highlight definitions \knowdef{like this} if you are expected to know and be able to state the definitions, and \usedef{like this} if you are just expected to be able to use the definition and explain the idea of it if given it, but not to be able to state it.

\section{L2: Eulerianity, simple graphs and subgraphs}
In our first lecture of the course we started softly, giving the definitions of a \knowdef{multigraph}, a \knowdef{walk}, a \knowdef{trail}, a \knowdef{path}, a \knowdef{circuit}, and a \knowdef{cycle}.

Then we defined what it means for a graph to be \knowdef{connected}, and what its \knowdef{connected components} are.

Having made all these definitions, we defined an \knowdef{Eulerian trail} to be a trail using every edge exactly once, and stated and proved \kskp{Euler's theorem on Eulerian paths}, which characterizes when a graph is Eulerian in terms of the \knowdef{degree} of its vertices.

Then, we stated and proved the \kskp{handshake lemma}, which says that
$$2\abs{E} = \sum_{v \in V} d_v.$$

Having done all this, we defined a \knowdef{simple graph}\sidenote[][]{Which is of course, for most of the course, the only notion of graph we referred to -- so generally we end up just calling these \emph{graphs}.}, and what a \knowdef{graph morphism} of simple graphs is, in terms of which we could then define \knowdef{isomorphism} of graphs.

Once we knew what it meant for graphs to be isomorphic, we could define an \usedef{unlabelled graph} to be an isomorphism class of graphs.\sidenote[][]{We largely did not end up actually using this concept -- other than in a few counting arguments, where we needed to be clear that we were \emph{not} considering unlabelled but labelled graphs.}

We ended the lecture by defining what a \knowdef{subgraph}, an \knowdef{induced subgraph}, an \knowdef{edge-induced subgraph}, and a \knowdef{spanning subgraph} is.

\section{L3: Common graph families, trees, and Cayley's theorem}

We started the lecture with giving definitions of a couple of commonly occuring graph families: the \knowdef{complete graphs}, \knowdef{path graphs}, \knowdef{cycle graphs}, \knowdef{complete bipartite graphs}, and \knowdef{complete multipartite graphs}.

Then we moved on to the main topic of the lecture: \knowdef{Trees}. We started by proving that \kskp{any tree on $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges}. We then stated, but did not prove,\sidenote[][]{The proof was deferred until the next lecture, when we were able to prove it as a corollary of a more general result.} \ksip{Cayley's formula} on the number of labelled trees on $n$ vertices.

Having done this, we proved a \iskp{characterisation of trees} in terms of three properties equivalent to being a tree. Then, we defined the notion of a \knowdef{spanning tree}, and proved that \ksnp{all multigraphs have a spanning tree, assuming the axiom of choice}.\sidenote[][]{In fact, the two statements -- existence of spanning trees for arbitrary graphs and the axiom of choice -- are equivalent.}

\section{L4: Spectral graph theory and the matrix-tree theorem}

We started by defining the \knowdef{adjacency matrix} of a graph, then we defined what we mean by a \knowdef{directed graph}, and used that to define what an \knowdef{incidence matrix} of a graph is.

We then proved that the \ksip{rank of the incidence matrix} equals the number of vertices minus the number of connected components. We then defined our final matrix associated to a graph, the \knowdef{Laplacian} $Q$ of a graph, and we showed that \kskp{the Laplacian satisfies $Q = DD^t$}.

Then we did \isnp{a bunch more linear algebra stuff} in order to finally arrive at the \ksnp{Kirchhoff matrix-tree theorem}. We then used this to give a proof of \ksip{Cayley's formula}, which we had stated in the previous lecture.

\section{L6: Weights, distances, and minimum spanning trees}

We started by defining \knowdef{Prim's algorithm}. Then we stated and proved that \kskp{removing an edge from a tree yields a forest of two trees}. Then we proved that \ksip{Prim's algorithm is correct}.

Then, we defined \knowdef{Kruskal's algorithm}, and \ksip{proved that it is correct}. After this, we defined the \knowdef{graph distance} and thus the \knowdef{diameter} of a graph. Having done this, we could define \knowdef{Dijkstra's algorithm}.

\section{L7: The max-flow min-cut and marriage theorems}

We defined what a \knowdef{weighted} directed graph is, and what a \knowdef{flow network} is. Then we defined what a \knowdef{flow} on these networks is, and its \knowdef{value}.

We then defined a \knowdef{cut} on a flow network and its \knowdef{capacity}, and showed that \kskp{the value of any flow is upper bounded by the capacity of any cut}. We then defined the \usedef{residual network} of a flow, and defined an \knowdef{augmenting path} in this network.

We stated that \ksnp{any augmenting path can be used to find a higher-value flow}, and used this to show the \ksip{Ford-Fulkerson theorem}.

Then, we defined what a \knowdef{matching} and a \knowdef{bipartite} graph is, and stated and proved \ksip{Hall's marriage theorem} using the max-flow-min-cut duality we had just seen.

\section{L8: Vertex covers, Hamilton cycles, independent sets}

We continued on the themes of the previous lecture, using max-flow-min-cut to prove \isip{K\"onig's theorem} relating \usedef{vertex covers} to the largest matching on a bipartite graph.

Then, we defined \knowdef{Hamilton cycles}, and stated and proved \ksip{Dirac's theorem}.

The penultimate topic of the lecture was \knowdef{independent sets} and the \knowdef{indepence number} $\alpha(G)$ of a graph $G$. We defined the \knowdef{line graph} of a graph, and noted that matchings are just independent sets in the line graph.

Then we stated and proved that the problem of determining \ksip{whether a graph has an independent set of size $k$ is NP-Complete}. Nevertheless, we were able to prove the \kskp{Caro-Wei theorem} giving a lower bound on the independence number of a graph, which was our first example of a proof using the probabilistic method.

Finally, in a little section of only definitions and nearly no theorems, we defined \knowdef{vertex colourings} of graphs, the \knowdef{chromatic number} $\chi(G)$ of a graph, and the \knowdef{clique number} of a graph.
