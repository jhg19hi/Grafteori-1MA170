\section{Introduction}

This paper is a short summary of Stuart E. Dreyfus' paper 
\textit{An appraisal of some shortest-path algorithms}, where five 
different shortest paths problems are discussed and how good 
different algorithms are at solving the problems.  \\
\indent We strive with this summary to summarize the arguments presented
pertaining to the different problems, as well as try to give an 
overview of the algorithms presented to simplify understanding. 

\section{Part 1: The shortest-path problem}
To start off the shortest path problem S.E. Dreyfus presents the problem in greater detail
as well as a computationally efficient algorithm solving the problem by Whiting and Hillier.
The algorithm will be skipped since it's presented in relatively great detail in Dreyfus's paper;
but it's worth mentioning the computational complexity of it, since it's referenced many times
while he discusses other algorithms. The algorithm requires $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ additions and $N(N-1)$ 
comparisons to solve the problem; where N is the number of nodes. Next he presents other
algorithms pertaining to the problem and starts off with Pollack and Wiebenson's paper [6], but does not present the algorithm, which will be done in this summary, to 
further simplify understanding of the points presented pertaining to it. In the paper a duality 
is presented with Minty's and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (where the shortest path is a special case of
the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for network flows), since the Ford-fulkerson algorithm is relatively well
known, only Minty's algorithm will be presented before the duality is explained. Minty's algorithm 
as it is presented in Pollack and Wiebenson's paper:

\noindent For the shortest-path problem between two specified cities (nodes).
Label the starting city `A' and the desired destination city `B' (the terminating city). \\
\indent \textbf{1.} Label the starting city A with the distance `zero' \\
\indent \textbf{2.} Look at all one-way streets with their `tails' labeled
and their `heads' unlabeled. For each such street, form the sum of the label and the length. Select a
street making this sum a minimum and place a check-mark beside it. Label the
`head' city of this street with the sum. Return to the beginning of 2 

\vspace{2mm}

\noindent According to S.E. Dreyfus, Minty's algorithm is combined with the Ford-Fulkerson
algorithm to make the \textit{Minty-Ford-Fulkerson} algorithm which is stated to be
easily programmed, but on the other hand significantly slower than the algorithm he
started off by presenting, needing a total of $\frac{N^{3}}{6}$ additions and comparisons, versus
the $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ additions and $N(N-1)$ comparisons of the previous algorithm. S.E. Dreyfus does
present a paper by Whiting and Hillier that discusses a modification to the algorithm
that speeds up the Minty-Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, but according to Dreyfus, it's not
enough in order to compete with Dijkstra's algorithm.

\section{Part 3: Determination of the second-shortest path}
Stuart E. Dreyfus also talks about the problem of finding the second-shortest 
path through a network. To solve this problem he talks about different methods. 
Firstly Dreyfus refers to the method described by Hoffman and Pavley [27]. 
The method says that the second-shortest path between specified  initial and terminal 
nodes is the deviation from the shortest path. The deviation from the shortest path is 
defined “to be a path that coincides with the shortest path (j may be the origin or the
terminal node), then deviates directly to some node k not the next node of the shortest
path, and finally proceeds from k to the fixed terminal node via the shortest path 
from k”. Using this method will approximately use MK additions and comparisons, beyond
the ones needed to find the shortest path, where M is the average node outgoing 
links and K is the number of arcs in the shortest path. 
\vspace{2mm}
Secondly Dreyfus refers to the method described by Bellman and Kalaba
[28]. This method uses the equation:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        & v_{i} = \min \left[
        \begin{aligned} 
            & \min_{i \neq j}\!_2(d_{ij} + u_{j}), \\
            & \min_{j \neq i}\!_1(d_{ij} + v_{j})
        \end{aligned} 
        \right],\\
        & v_{N} = \min_{i}\!_1[d_{Ni} + u_{i}].
    \end{aligned}
    \hspace*{3em} (i = 1, \dots, N - 1) 
\end{equation}

\noindent In this equation ui is defined as the length of the shortest path from the node i
to the terminal node N and vi as the length of the second shortest path. 
The term $\min \!_2(d_{ij}+u_j)$ determines the best path beginning in node i 
and deviating from the shortest path in node i and the term $\min\!_1(d_{ij}+v_j) $
evaluates the best path with any first arc and the second best continuation. 
Bellman and Kalaba recommends solving the equation above using an iterative procedure 
until convergence by elevating vi on the left with $(k+1)$ and vj on the right with (k). 
Using this method will need an average of NML additions and comparisons, where L is the 
number of iterations needed. Dreyfus compares this method to Hoffman and Pavley and 
says that Hoffman and Pavley's method is the better one because it requires less 
calculations.
\vspace{2mm}
Dreyfus also writes about a method from Pollack's [29] paper to find the 
third-shortest path from all initial nodes to N. We get this path by following

\begin{equation}
    w_i = \min \left[
    \begin{aligned}
        & d_{ik} + v_k \\
        & d_{im} + v_m \\
        & \min_{j \neq i} \!_3 [d_{ij} + u_j]
    \end{aligned}
    \right].
\end{equation}

\noindent Let $w_i$ represent the length of the third-shortest path from $i$,
$v_i$ the second-shortest path and $u_i$ the shortest path. If $u_i$ 
and $v_i$ is determined then $w_i$ can be computed node by node, this 
by first computing nodes that are one arc distance from N, then two etc. 

\newpage
\section{Part 4: Time-dependant length of arcs}
S.E Drayfus refers to the paper [30] that studied the problem of finding 
the fastest paths between cities, where travel time depends on departure 
from the starting city. In the paper, Cooke and Halsey refer to two cities
as i and j and denote $d_{ij}(t)$ as the travel time where $t$ is the time of 
departure and defines a function $f_i(t)$ as the minimum travel time to N. 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        & f_i(t) = \min_{j \neq i}[d_{ij}(t)+f_j(t+d_{ij}(t))] \\
        & f_N(t) = 0
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The authors present an iterative algorithm for finding the quickest 
paths from all cities to city N. The algorithm can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start at city i at time 0 
    \item Define T as the maximum time taken over all initial cities 
    \item Assume all cities are connected, even if it takes an infinite time
    \item The procedure requires most $N^{2}T^{2}$additions and comparisons 
    \item Use tentative and permanent labels for nodes (cities) 
    \item Permanently label the initial node $i$ as 0 and all the others nodes as infinity
    \item Tentatively label nodes with the minimum of the current label and the sum of the current label and the time taken to travel to that node.
    \item Find the minimum, non-permanent node label and declare it permanent.
    \item Use the selected node to update labels at other tentatively labeled cities.
    \item Repeat steps 8\--9 until city $N$ is permanently labeled.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent After most $N^{2}$ comparisons and $\frac{N^{2}}{2}$ additions, 
the quickest paths to all nodes, including $N$, are determined. A similar 
result is achieved by using a variant of the Dijkstra algorithm, where $\frac{N^{2}}{2}$
additions and $2N^{2}$comparisons are required. If the quickest path from all 
cities to $N$ is wanted the algorithm must be repeated $N-1$ times. This 
procedure compares favorably in computation and required assumptions with 
Cooke and Halsey's algorithm.

\newpage

\section{Part 5: Shortest path visiting specified nodes}
The last problem S.E Dreyfus discusses in the paper is the problem of
finding the shortest path between two specified nodes 1 and $N$ that pass
through $k-1$ nodes $(2,3,\dots,k \leq N-1)$. Dreyfus critiques a solution given to 
the problem by Saksena and Kumar [31]. The solution proposed by Saksena and 
Kumar assumes that the shortest path from a specified node $i$ to the destination 
node $N$, passing through at least p specified nodes can be broken down into two problems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Finding the shortest path from $i$ to some specified node $j$.
    \item Finding the shortest path from $j$ to $N$, passing through at 
    least $p-r-1$ specified nodes, where $r$ is the number of 
    specified nodes on the shortest unrestricted path from $i$ to $j$.
    \item Should some candidate path corresponding to some $j$ violate the 
    duplication-of-nodes proviso above, that possibility is inadmissible 
    and the possibility of going initially from $i$ to $j$ by the shortest path
    is dropped from consideration.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Dreyfus means that the procedure of the algorithm is flawed. He argues 
that the algorithm fails to take into account that in this case an alternative path, 
avoiding the duplication of nodes, may yield a better overall solution. 
Dreyfus asserts that the problem can be correctly solved as follows assuming 
paths with loops are admissible: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solve the shortest path problem for the N-node network for all pairs of
    initial and final nodes. Let $d_{ij}$ represent the length of the shortest path 
    from node $i$ to $j$.
    \item Solve the k+1 “traveling-salesman” problem for the shortest path from 
    1 to $N$ passing through nodes $2, 3, \dots,k$ where the distance from node 
    $i$ to $j$ is $d_{ij}$. 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Notes}
Some notes that didn't fit with the flow of the summary.
In part 1 it's worth mentioning that it's not clear what algorithm from
Pollack and Wiebenson's paper S.E. Dreyfus has named the Minty-Ford-Fulkerson
algorithm, as it's not explicitly stated in the paper that there's a combination
of Minty's algorithm and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm; but in their section \textit{Dual
Solutions} they do discuss a changed Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. Dreyfus's
paper originally covers 5 parts but because of group problems we decided to
only cover 4 out of the 5 parts. The part we skipped was part 2, 
\textit{The shortest paths between all pairs of nodes of a network}.
